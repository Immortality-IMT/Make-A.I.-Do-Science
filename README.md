# Scientific Method Learning A.I.

The goal of this project is to equip A.I. to perform the scientific method without any human intervention. So you turn on the A.I. and off it goes doing science, come back in a year.

Scientific Method Learning utilizes the scientific method to learn.

The scientific method involves 6 steps and 6 competencies which the A.I. must perform. 



These competencies can be met in 3 different ways currently, by prompt engineering, fine-tuning and building new models from scratch.
