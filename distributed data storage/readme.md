Leverage IPFS for storing training data or suggest your own.

Dotoring training data means the data is spread over the network without one node nesessarily holding the entire file.
Training models can take petabytes so that distributed data storage solution is essential.

sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y curl tar

curl -L https://dist.ipfs.io/go-ipfs/v0.8.0/go-ipfs_0.8.0_linux-amd64.tar.gz | tar xz

cd go-ipfs
./ipfs init --clean

./ipfs daemon

./ipfs add /etc/passwd

http://localhost:8080/ipfs/QmYwAPJzv5CZsnA625s3Xf2nemtYgPpHdWEz79ojWnPbdG

Bring some bytes to the network if you want to train some models.
